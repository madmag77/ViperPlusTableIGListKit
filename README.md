Demonstration sample of usage IGListKit 2.1 in VIPER module to display grid.

Aims:
1. Figure out how to work with IGListKit in Objective-C
2. Incapsulate all IGListKit specific in DataSource and hide it behind protocol
3. Decide on what VIPER level should be DataSource - View or Presenter. Finally I created it in View, and use it in Presenter.
4. Make Presenter not depended on Data models using ViewModels Factory
